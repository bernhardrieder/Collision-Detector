# Collision Detector
This project is an exercise for the course Physics and Simulation at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien. Generally it's about performance issues in dynamic and interactive collision detection. It shows how different collision detection approaches affects the performance - starting with the less reliable and fastest method up to the the almost best and slowest method for interactive collision detection.
